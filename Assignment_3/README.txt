Assignment: Assignment 3 - Memory Allocation  
Author(s): Darryl Ming Sen Lee 

Language: Python 3.8.5
IDE: Visual Studio Code

Command to run code: 
    python3 Application.py <filename>

Problems:
    I am having trouble coding Explicit Free list function so it is still having issues. I was not able to complete the assignment fully as it is a difficult task for the explicit.
    However the Implicit part should be working fine with proper input and output as expected.
